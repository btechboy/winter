# QUADCOPTER

## Summary
I am going to build a QUADCOPTER that will help me to understand the basics of drones' structure and working. 

From this project, I will be able to aquire hands-on experience over the concepts that I learnt so-far and will definitely learn new things. This project can further help me survey and monitor huge fields and produce actionable data which can further be used in my current field of study. As Drones are already used in agriculture, so this will help me in monitoring the crops' health and many futuristic possiblities.

 This will be a great jump-start in the journey of my career and I am really excited to build it.

## Plan

Steps and tools I might use to build a basic DIY quadcopter:

1. Gather materials and tools: To build a quadcopter, I will need a variety of materials and tools, including a quadcopter frame, motors, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), a flight controller, a battery, a radio transmitter and receiver, and various hardware such as screws, nuts, and connectors.

2. Assemble the frame: The first step in building the quadcopter is to assemble the frame. This involves attaching the various frame components together using screws or other hardware. I will need a screwdriver and pliers for this step.

3. Installing the electronic components: Once the frame is assembled, I will then install the electronic components of the quadcopter, including the flight controller, motors, and ESCs. I will also need a soldering iron and heat shrink tubing for this step.

4. Connect the power distribution board: Next, I will need to connect the power distribution board (PDB) to the frame. The PDB is used to distribute power from the battery to the electronic components of the quadcopter.

5. Install the radio receiver and transmitter: The next step is to install the radio receiver and transmitter. This is the device that will allow you to control the quadcopter remotely.

6. Configure and test: Once all the components are installed, I will need to configure and test the quadcopter. This involves configuring the flight controller software, calibrating the sensors, and performing test flights.

7. Final assembly and calibration: After the testing and configuration are complete, I can finish the final assembly of the quadcopter and calibrate it for the first flight.
